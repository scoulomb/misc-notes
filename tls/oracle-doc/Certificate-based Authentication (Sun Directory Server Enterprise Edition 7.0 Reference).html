<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19424-01/820-4811/6ng8i26aq/index.html#gdzdl">Figure&nbsp;5–2</a> shows how certificates
and the SSL protocol are used together for authentication. To authenticate
a user to a server, a client digitally signs a randomly generated piece of
data and sends both the certificate and the signed data across the network.
For the purposes of this discussion, the digital signature associated with
some data can be thought of as evidence provided by the client to the server.
The server authenticates the user’s identity on the strength of this
evidence.</p>
<p>Like for password-based authentication illustrated in <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19424-01/820-4811/6ng8i26ag/index.html#gdzej">Figure&nbsp;5–1</a>, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19424-01/820-4811/6ng8i26aq/index.html#gdzdl">Figure&nbsp;5–2</a> assumes that the user has already decided to trust the server and
has requested a resource. The server has requested client authentication in
the process of evaluating whether to grant access to the requested resource.</p>
<a name="gdzdl"></a><h5 class="sol">Figure&nbsp;5–2  Certificate-Based Authentication</h5><br><img alt="Figure shows certificate-based authentication" title="Figure shows certificate-based authentication" src="Certificate-based%20Authentication%20(Sun%20Directory%20Server%20Enterprise%20Edition%207.0%20Reference)_files/certpwd.gif"><p></p><p>Unlike for password-based authentication illustrated in <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19424-01/820-4811/6ng8i26ag/index.html#gdzej">Figure&nbsp;5–1</a>, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19424-01/820-4811/6ng8i26aq/index.html#gdzdl">Figure&nbsp;5–2</a> requires the use of SSL. In <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19424-01/820-4811/6ng8i26aq/index.html#gdzdl">Figure&nbsp;5–2</a> it is assumed that the client has a valid certificate that can be
used to identify the client to the server.</p>
<p>Certificate-based authentication is generally considered preferable
to password-based authentication because it is based on what the user has,
the private key, as well as what the user knows, the password that protects
the private key. However, it’s important to note that these two assumptions
are true only if unauthorized personnel have not gained access to the user’s
machine or password, the password for the client software’s private
key database has been set, and the software is set up to request the password
at reasonably frequent intervals.</p>
<hr><b>Note – </b><p>Neither password-based authentication nor certificate-based authentication
address security issues related to physical access to individual machines
or passwords. Public-key cryptography can only verify that a private key used
to sign some data corresponds to the public key in a certificate. It is the
user’s responsibility to protect a machine’s physical security
and to keep the private-key password secret.</p>
<hr>
<p>Certificates replace the authentication portion of the interaction between
the client and the server. Instead of requiring a user to send passwords across
the network throughout the day, single sign-on requires the user to enter
the private-key database password just once, without sending it across the
network. For the rest of the session, the client presents the user’s
certificate to authenticate the user to each new server it encounters. Existing
authorization mechanisms based on the authenticated user identity are not
affected. </p>
<a name="6ng8i26ar"></a><h3 class="sol">Certificates and Certificate Authorities (CA)</h3>
<p>A certificate is an electronic document that identifies an individual,
a server, a company, or some other entity. A certificate also associates that
identity with a public key. Like a driver’s license, a passport, or
other commonly used personal IDs, a certificate provides generally recognized
proof of someone's or something's identity.</p>
<p>Certificate authorities, CAs, validate identities
and issue certificates. CAs can be independent third parties
or organizations that run their own certificate-issuing server software. The
methods used to validate an identity vary depending on the policies of a given
CA. In general, before issuing a certificate, the CA must
use its published verification procedures for that type of certificate to
ensure that an entity requesting a certificate is in fact who it claims to
be.</p>
<p>A certificate issued by a CA binds a particular public
key to the name of the entity the certificate identifies, such as the name
of an employee or a server. Certificates help prevent the use of fake public
keys for impersonation. Only the public key certified by the certificate works
with the corresponding private key possessed by the entity identified by the
certificate.</p>
<p>In addition to a public key, a certificate always includes the name
of the entity it identifies, an expiration date, the name of the CA that issued
the certificate, a serial number, and other information. Most importantly,
a certificate always includes the digital signature of the issuing CA. The
CA’s digital signature allows the certificate to function as a “letter
of introduction” for users who know and trust the CA but don’t
know the entity identified by the certificate.</p>
<p>Any client or server software that supports certificates maintains a
collection of trusted CA certificates. These CA certificates determine which
other certificates the software can validate, in other words, which issuers
of certificates the software can trust. In the simplest case, the software
can validate only certificates issued by one of the CAs for which it has a
certificate. It’s also possible for a trusted CA certificate to be part
of a chain of CA certificates, each issued by the CA above it in a certificate
hierarchy.</p>
<p>For information about CAs, see the following sections:</p>

<a name="6ng8i26at"></a><h4 class="sol">CA Hierarchies</h4><a name="indexterm-150"></a><p>In large organizations, it may be appropriate to delegate the responsibility
for issuing certificates to several different certificate authorities. For
example, the number of certificates required may be too large for a single
CA to maintain; different organizational units may have different policy requirements;
or it may be important for a CA to be physically located in the same geographic
area as the people to whom it is issuing certificates.</p>
<p>It’s possible to delegate certificate-issuing responsibilities
to subordinate CAs. The X.509 standard includes a model for setting up a hierarchy
of CAs.</p>
<a name="gdzcz"></a><h5 class="sol">Figure&nbsp;5–3  Hierarchy of Certificate Authorities</h5><br><img alt="Figure shows a hierarchy of certificate authorities" title="Figure shows a hierarchy of certificate authorities" src="Certificate-based%20Authentication%20(Sun%20Directory%20Server%20Enterprise%20Edition%207.0%20Reference)_files/hier.gif"><p></p><p>
<a name="indexterm-151"></a><a name="indexterm-152"></a>In
this model, the root CA is at the top of the hierarchy. The root CA’s
certificate is a <b>self-signed certificate</b>. That is, the
certificate is digitally signed by the same entity, the root CA, that the
certificate identifies. The CAs that are directly subordinate to the root
CA have CA certificates signed by the root CA. CAs under the subordinate CAs
in the hierarchy have their CA certificates signed by the higher-level subordinate
CAs.</p>
<p>Organizations have a great deal of flexibility in terms of the way they
set up their CA hierarchies. <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19424-01/820-4811/6ng8i26at/index.html#gdzcz">Figure&nbsp;5–3</a> shows
just one example; many other arrangements are possible.</p>

<a name="6ng8i26au"></a><h4 class="sol">Certificate Chains</h4><p>
<a name="indexterm-153"></a>CA hierarchies are reflected in certificate chains. A <b>certificate
chain</b> is a series of certificates issued by successive CAs. <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19424-01/820-4811/6ng8i26au/index.html#gdzdi">Figure&nbsp;5–4</a> shows a certificate chain
leading from a certificate that identifies some entity through two subordinate
CA certificates to the CA certificate for the root CA (based on the CA hierarchy
shown in the following figure).</p>
<a name="gdzdi"></a><h5 class="sol">Figure&nbsp;5–4  Certificate Chain</h5><br><img alt="Figure shows a certificate chain." title="Figure shows a certificate chain." src="Certificate-based%20Authentication%20(Sun%20Directory%20Server%20Enterprise%20Edition%207.0%20Reference)_files/chn.gif"><p></p><p>A certificate chain traces a path of certificates from a branch in the
hierarchy to the root of the hierarchy. In a certificate chain, the following
occur:</p>
<a name=""></a><ul>
<li>
<p>Each certificate is followed by the certificate of its issuer.</p>


</li>
<li>
<p>In <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19424-01/820-4811/6ng8i26au/index.html#gdzdi">Figure&nbsp;5–4</a>,
the Engineering CA certificate contains the DN of the CA (that is, USA CA),
that issued that certificate. USA CA’s DN is also the subject name of
the next certificate in the chain.</p>


</li>
<li>
<p>Each certificate is signed with the private key of its issuer.
The signature can be verified with the public key in the issuer’s certificate,
which is the next certificate in the chain.</p>


</li>
</ul>
<p>In <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19424-01/820-4811/6ng8i26au/index.html#gdzdi">Figure&nbsp;5–4</a>, the public
key in the certificate for the USA CA can be used to verify the USA CA’s
digital signature on the certificate for the Engineering CA.</p>

<a name="6ng8i26av"></a><h4 class="sol">Verifying a Certificate Chain</h4><p>
<a name="indexterm-154"></a>Certificate chain verification is the process
of making sure a given certificate chain is well-formed, valid, properly signed,
and trustworthy. Directory Server software uses the following steps to
form and verify a certificate chain, starting with the certificate being presented
for authentication:</p>
<a name=""></a><ol type="1">
<li>
<p>The certificate validity period is checked against the current
time provided by the verifier’s system clock.</p>


</li>
<li>
<p>The issuer’s certificate is located. The source can
be either the verifier’s local certificate database (on that client
or server) or the certificate chain provided by the subject (for example,
over an SSL connection).</p>


</li>
<li>
<p>The certificate signature is verified using the public key
in the issuer certificate.</p>


</li>
<li>
<p>If the issuer’s certificate is trusted by the verifier
in the verifier’s certificate database, verification stops successfully
here. Otherwise, the issuer’s certificate is checked to make sure it
contains the appropriate subordinate CA indication in the Directory Server certificate
type extension, and chain verification returns to step 1 to start again, but
with this new certificate.</p>

<a name="6ng8i26b0"></a><h3 class="sol">Types of Certificates</h3>
<p>Directory Server uses the following types of certificate:</p>
<a name=""></a><dl>
<dt>Client SSL certificates</dt>
<dd>
<p>Client SSL certificates are used to identify clients to servers
via SSL (client authentication). Typically, the identity of the client is
assumed to be the same as the identity of a human being, such as an employee
in an enterprise. Client SSL certificates can also be used for form signing
and as part of a single sign-on solution.</p>

<p>For example, a bank gives a customer a client SSL certificate that allows
the bank’s servers to identify that customer and authorize access to
the customer’s accounts. A company might give a new employee a client
SSL certificate that allows the company’s servers to identify that employee
and authorize access to the company’s servers.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Server SSL certificates</dt>
<dd>
<p>Server SSL certificates are used to identify servers to clients
via SSL (server authentication). Server authentication may be used with or
without client authentication. Server authentication is a requirement for
an encrypted SSL session.</p>

<p>For example, internet sites that engage in electronic commerce usually
support certificate-based server authentication, at a minimum, to establish
an encrypted SSL session and to assure customers that they are dealing with
a web site identified with a particular company. The encrypted SSL session
ensures that personal information sent over the network, such as credit card
numbers, cannot easily be intercepted.</p>

</dd>
<dt>S/MIME certificates</dt>
<dd>
<p>S/MIME certificates are used for signed and encrypted email.
As with client SSL certificates, the identity of the client is typically assumed
to be the same as the identity of a human being, such as an employee in an
enterprise. A single certificate may be used as both an S/MIME certificate
and an SSL certificate. S/MIME certificates can also be used for form signing
and as part of a single sign-on solution.</p>

<p>For example, a company deploys combined S/MIME and SSL certificates
solely for the purpose of authenticating employee identities, thus permitting
signed email and client SSL authentication but not encrypted email. Another
company issues S/MIME certificates solely for the purpose of both signing
and encrypting email that deals with sensitive financial or legal matters.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Object-signing certificates</dt>
<dd>
<p>Object-signing certificates are used to identify signers of
Java code, JavaScript scripts, or other signed files.</p>

<p>For example, a software company signs software distributed over the
Internet to provide users with some assurance that the software is a legitimate
product of that company. Using certificates and digital signatures in this
manner can also make it possible for users to identify and control the kind
of access downloaded software has to their computers.</p>

</dd>
<dt>CA certificates</dt>
<dd>
<p>CA certificates are used to identify CAs. Client and server
software use CA certificates to determine what other certificates can be trusted.</p>

<p>For example, the CA certificates stored in client software determine
what other certificates that client can authenticate. An administrator can
implement some aspects of corporate security policies by controlling the CA
certificates stored in each user’s client.</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<a name="6ng8i26b1"></a><h3 class="sol">Contents of a Certificate</h3>
<a name="indexterm-155"></a><p>The contents of certificates supported by Directory Server and many
other software companies are organized according to the X.509 v3 certificate
specification, which has been recommended by the International Telecommunications
Union (ITU), an international standards body, since 1988. Examples in this
section show samples of the data and signature sections of a certificate.</p>
<a name=""></a><p>Every X.509 certificate consists of the following sections.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A data section, including the following information.</p>

<a name=""></a>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The version number of the X.509 standard supported by the
certificate.</p>


</li>
<li>
<p>The certificate’s serial number. Every certificate issued
by a CA has a serial number that is unique among the certificates issued by
that CA.</p>


</li>
<li>
<p>Information about the user’s public key, including the
algorithm used and a representation of the key itself.</p>


</li>
<li>
<p>The DN of the CA that issued the certificate.</p>


</li>
<li>
<p>The period during which the certificate is valid (for example,
between 1:00 p.m. on November 15, 2003 and 1:00 p.m. November 15, 2004).</p>


</li>
<li>
<p>The DN of the certificate subject (for example, in a client
SSL certificate this would be the user’s DN), also called the subject
name.</p>


</li>
<li>
<p>Optional <b>certificate extensions,</b> which
may provide additional data used by the client or server. For example, the
certificate type extension indicates the type of certificate—that is,
whether it is a client SSL certificate, a server SSL certificate, a certificate
for signing email, and so on. Certificate extensions can also be used for
a variety of other purposes.</p>


</li>
</ul>


</li>
<li>
<p>A signature section, includes the following information.</p>

<a name=""></a>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The cryptographic algorithm, or cipher, used by the issuing
CA to create its own digital signature.</p>


</li>
<li>
<p>The CA’s digital signature, obtained by hashing all
of the data in the certificate together and encrypting it with the CA's private
key.</p>

<a name="6ng8i26b4"></a><h4 class="sol">Issuing Certificates</h4><a name="indexterm-157"></a><p>The process for issuing a certificate depends on the certificate authority
that issues it and the purpose for which it is used. The process for issuing
non-digital forms of identification varies in similar ways. For example, if
you want to get a generic ID card (not a driver’s license) from the
Department of Motor Vehicles in California, the requirements are straightforward:
you need to present some evidence of your identity, such as a utility bill
with your address on it and a student identity card. If you want to get a
regular driving license, you also need to take a test — a driving test
when you first get the license, and a written test when you renew it. If you
want to get a commercial license for an eighteen-wheeler, the requirements
are much more stringent. If you live in some other state or country, the requirements
for various kinds of licenses differ.</p>
<p>Similarly, different CAs have different procedures for issuing different
kinds of certificates. In some cases the only requirement may be your mail
address. In other cases, your UNIX login and password may be sufficient. At
the other end of the scale, for certificates that identify people who can
authorize large expenditures or make other sensitive decisions, the issuing
process may require notarized documents, a background check, and a personal
interview.</p>
<p>Depending on an organization’s policies, the process of issuing
certificates can range from being completely transparent for the user to requiring
significant user participation and complex procedures. In general, processes
for issuing certificates should be highly flexible, so organizations can tailor
them to their changing needs.</p>
<p>Issuing certificates is one of several management tasks that can be
handled by separate Registration Authorities.</p>

<a name="6ng8i26b5"></a><h4 class="sol">Certificates and the LDAP Directory</h4><a name="indexterm-158"></a><p>The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for accessing directory
services supports great flexibility in the management of certificates within
an organization. System administrators can store much of the information required
to manage certificates in an LDAP-compliant directory. For example, a CA can
use information in a directory to pre-populate a certificate with a new employee’s
legal name and other information. The CA can leverage directory information
in other ways to issue certificates one at a time or in bulk, using a range
of different identification techniques depending on the security policies
of a given organization. Other routine management tasks, such as key management
and renewing and revoking certificates, can be partially or fully automated
with the aid of the directory.</p>
<p>Information stored in the directory can also be used with certificates
to control access to various network resources by different users or groups.
Issuing certificates and other certificate management tasks can thus be an
integral part of user and group management.</p>

<a name="6ng8i26b6"></a><h4 class="sol">Key Management</h4><a name="indexterm-159"></a><a name="indexterm-160"></a><p>Before a certificate can be issued, the public key it contains and the
corresponding private key must be generated. Sometimes it may be useful to
issue a single person one certificate and key pair for signing operations,
and another certificate and key pair for encryption operations. Separate signing
and encryption certificates make it possible to keep the private signing key
on the local machine only, thus providing maximum non-repudiation, and to
back up the private encryption key in some central location where it can be
retrieved in case the user loses the original key or leaves the company.</p>
<p>Keys can be generated by client software or generated centrally by the
CA and distributed to users via an LDAP directory. There are trade-offs involved
in choosing between local and centralized key generation. For example, local
key generation provides maximum non-repudiation, but may involve more participation
by the user in the issuing process. Flexible key management capabilities are
essential for most organizations.</p>
<p>
<b>Key recovery,</b> or the ability to retrieve backups
of encryption keys under carefully defined conditions, can be a crucial part
of certificate management (depending on how an organization uses certificates).
Key recovery schemes usually involve an <b>m of n</b> mechanism:
for example, <var>m</var> of <var>n</var> managers
within an organization might have to agree, and each contribute a special
code or key of their own, before a particular person’s encryption key
can be recovered. This kind of mechanism ensures that several authorized personnel
must agree before an encryption key can be recovered.</p>

<a name="6ng8i26b7"></a><h4 class="sol">Renewal and Revocation of Certificates</h4><a name="indexterm-161"></a><a name="indexterm-162"></a><p>Like a driver’s license, a certificate specifies a period of time
during which it is valid. Attempts to use a certificate for authentication
before or after its validity period fails. Therefore, mechanisms for managing
certificate renewal are essential for any certificate management strategy.
For example, an administrator may wish to be notified automatically when a
certificate is about to expire, so that an appropriate renewal process can
be completed in plenty of time without causing the certificate’s subject
any inconvenience. The renewal process may involve reusing the same public-private
key pair or issuing a new one.</p>
<p>A driver’s license can be suspended even if it has not expired—for
example, as punishment for a serious driving offense. Similarly, it’s
sometimes necessary to revoke a certificate before it has expired—for
example, if an employee leaves a company or moves to a new job within the
company.</p>
<p>Certificate revocation can be handled in several different ways. For
some organizations, it may be sufficient to set up servers so that the authentication
process includes checking the directory for the presence of the certificate
being presented. When an administrator revokes a certificate, the certificate
can be automatically removed from the directory, and subsequent authentication
attempts with that certificate fails even though the certificate remains valid
in every other respect. Another approach involves publishing a certificate
revocation list (CRL)—that is, a list of revoked certificates—to
the directory at regular intervals and checking the list as part of the authentication
process. For some organizations, it may be preferable to check directly with
the issuing CA each time a certificate is presented for authentication. This
procedure is sometimes called real-time status checking.</p>

<a name="6ng8i26b8"></a><h4 class="sol">Registration Authorities</h4><p>Interactions between entities identified by certificates (sometimes
called end entities) and CAs are an essential part of certificate management.
These interactions include operations such as registration for certification,
certificate retrieval, certificate renewal, certificate revocation, and key
backup and recovery. In general, a CA must be able to authenticate the identities
of end entities before responding to the requests. In addition, some requests
need to be approved by authorized administrators or managers before being
serviced.</p>
<p>As previously discussed, the means used by different CAs to verify an
identity before issuing a certificate can vary widely, depending on the organization
and the purpose for which the certificate is used. To provide maximum operational
flexibility, interactions with end entities can be separated from the other
functions of a CA and handled by a separate service called a<a name="indexterm-163"></a><a name="indexterm-164"></a> <b>Registration Authority</b> RA.</p>
<p>An RA acts as a front end to a CA by receiving end entity requests,
authenticating them, and forwarding them to the CA. After receiving a response
from the CA, the RA notifies the end entity of the results. RAs can be helpful in scaling a PKI across different departments,
geographical areas, or other operational units with varying policies and authentication
requirements.</p>
