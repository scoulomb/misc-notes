# TLS explained to myself

## Basic crypto concept

[For the reamaining of this article. Alice is message sender, Bob is the receiver](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_et_Bob).

### Symetric cryptography

We use same key to encode and decode.

### Asymetric cryptography: we generate two keys, key1 and key2.

When we encode with key 1 we can decode with key 2  and vice versa.
One key is in general private, and other one is public.

Thus definition given [here](https://youtu.be/T4Df5_cojAs?t=128)

2 usages:

1. **Key encryption**: Any message encrypted with Bob's public key can only be decrypted with Bob's private key.
In that case Recipient (Bob) give public key to sender (Alice). 
Sender (Alice) use recipient (Bob) public key to encode message, recipient (Bob) use its private key to decode the message.

2. **Digital Signatures**: Anyone with access to Alice's public key can verify that a message 
could only have been created by someone with access to Alice's private key. (it was encrypted using private key here)

In that case Alice encrypt message using her private key. Bob check tries to decode (digital signature) using Alice public key. 
If he can decode, it proves Alice had encrypted this message.
We will see that this is what a CA does to digitally sign a certificate.

I had read:
It makes no sense to encrypt anything with your private key, 
because the message could then be decrypted by the public key that everybody has access to. 
When somebody wants to send you a secret message, they encrypt it using your public key, and then only you can decrypt it, 
because only you know your private key
-> not the case for signature

**Key encryption** and **digital signatures** are well in 2 related section of this doc:
https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19424-01/820-4811/6ng8i26ba/index.html

The pub/priv keys are related :

Quoting : https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/basic/concept/cryptography/encryption_algorithm.html

> Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithm is a kind of asymmetric encryption algorithm. With the irreversible feature of K=k*G process (K: public key, G: base point (constant)), it can prevent solving private key from public key by brutal force.

## Certificates

### See intro to certificate

Oracle doc: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19424-01/820-4811/6ng8i26ao/index.html

### Note cert can be used for 

- client authentification: signature
- Mail encryption (S/MIME certificate): encryption
- SSL/TLS (client and server SSL certificate): certifcates are signed and enables encryption keys exchange
- Signature of software delivery (object signing certifcate): signature
- Identify CA (CA certificates): signature


### Every X.509 certificate consists of the following sections.

- A data section, including the following information.
    - d1: The version number of the X.509 standard supported by the certificate.
    - d2: The certificate’s serial number. Every certificate issued by a CA has a serial number that is unique among the certificates issued by that CA.
    - d3: **Information about the user’s public key, including the algorithm used and a representation of the key itself.**
    - d4: **The DN of the CA that issued the certificate.**
    - d5: **The period during which the certificate is valid** (for example, between 1:00 p.m. on November 15, 2003 and 1:00 p.m. November 15, 2004).
    - d6: **The DN of the certificate subject** (for example, in a client SSL certificate this would be the user’s DN), also called the subject name.
    See also SAN: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_Alternative_Name and https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-common-name/#common-name-vs-subject-alternative-name. See [multidomain certificate](./multidomain-appendix.md).
    - d7: Optional certificate extensions, which may provide additional data used by the client or server. For example, the certificate type extension indicates the type of certificate—that is, whether it is a client SSL certificate, a server SSL certificate, a certificate for signing email, and so on. Certificate extensions can also be used for a variety of other purposes.

- A signature section, includes the following information.
    - s1: The cryptographic algorithm, or cipher, used by the issuing CA to create its own digital signature.
    - s2: **The CA’s digital signature, obtained by hashing all of the data in the certificate together and encrypting it with the CA's private key.**


### More details on sections and certificate hierarchy


See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_certificate#/media/File:Chain_Of_Trust.svg

![](./media/2560px-Chain_Of_Trust.svg.png)

The root CA will be used to sign lower hierarchy certificate.
Lower hierarchy certificate will contain:
- A DN (distinguished name) [(d6)](../tls-certificate.md#every-x509-certificate-consists-of-the-following-sections)
- public key of the certificate itself [(d3)](../tls-certificate.md#every-x509-certificate-consists-of-the-following-sections) 
- reference DN of the issuer: root CA (or subordinate CA), or upper certificate in the chain)  [(d4)](../tls-certificate.md#every-x509-certificate-consists-of-the-following-sections)
<!-- wikipedia has owner and issuer but both are issuer -->
- contain digital signature of the root CA (signed with CA private key), subordinate CA (signed with subordinate CA private key) or previous certificate in the chain (signed with previous certificate private key) [(s1, s2)](../tls-certificate.md#every-x509-certificate-consists-of-the-following-sections).


Root CA will contain
- CA name [(d6)](../tls-certificate.md#every-x509-certificate-consists-of-the-following-sections)
- Root CA public key key [(d3)](../tls-certificate.md#every-x509-certificate-consists-of-the-following-sections), matching root CA private key
- reference DN of issuer: itself [(d4)](../tls-certificate.md#every-x509-certificate-consists-of-the-following-sections)
- contain Root CA signature signed with root CA private key -- **Self-signed** --

**So a root CA is always a [Self-Signed Certificate?](../tls-certificate.md#self-signed-certificate). ** 

### chain certificate and certificate verification 

Quoting Oracle doc on certificate:
https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19424-01/820-4811/6ng8i26ao/index.html
Here is how certificate and chain of certificate are verified

![cert chain](media/chn.gif)

> A certificate chain traces a path of certificates from a branch in the hierarchy to the root of the hierarchy. In a certificate chain, the following occur:
> Each certificate is followed by the certificate of its issuer.
>  In Figure 5–4, the Engineering CA certificate contains the DN of the CA (that is, USA CA), that issued that certificate. USA CA’s DN is also the subject name of the next certificate in the chain.
>  Each certificate is signed with the private key of its issuer. The signature can be verified with the public key in the issuer’s certificate, which is the next certificate in the chain.

![cert chain verification](media/chver.gif)

> Verifying a Certificate Chain

> Certificate chain verification is the process of making sure a given certificate chain is well-formed, valid, properly signed, and trustworthy. Directory Server software uses the following steps to form and verify a certificate chain, starting with the certificate being presented for authentication:

> 1. The certificate validity period is checked against the current time provided by the verifier’s system clock. (d5)
> 2. The issuer’s certificate is located (d4). The source can be either the verifier’s local certificate database (on that client or server) or the certificate chain provided by the subject (for example, over an SSL connection).
> 3. The certificate signature is verified using the public key in the issuer certificate.(verify s2 by using d3 in the next certificate in the chain )
> If the issuer’s certificate is trusted by the verifier in the verifier’s certificate database, verification stops successfully here. Otherwise, the issuer’s certificate is checked to make sure it contains the appropriate subordinate CA indication in the Directory Server certificate type extension, and chain verification returns to step 1 to start again, but with this new certificate.

### Server Authentication During SSL Handshake

Quoting Oracle Doc on SSL those steps are added for SSL certificate.
As depicted here: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19424-01/820-4811/6ng8i26ba/index.html (Server Authentication During SSL Handshake)

> 4. Does the domain name in the server’s certificate match the domain name of the server itself?
> This step confirms that the server is actually located at the same network address specified by the domain name in the server certificate. Although step 4 is not technically part of the SSL protocol, it provides the only protection against a form of security attack known as man-in-the-middle. Clients must perform this step and must refuse to authenticate the server or establish a connection if the domain names don’t match. If the server’s actual domain name matches the domain name in the server certificate, the client goes on to the next step.
> 5. The server is authenticated.
The client proceeds with the SSL handshake. If the client doesn’t get to step 5 for any reason, the server identified by the certificate cannot be authenticated, and the user is warned of the problem and informed that an encrypted and authenticated connection cannot be established. 

During SSL (RSA) handshake we will see below that server private key (matching public key contained in server certificate) is used by server to decode pre-master secret generated by the client once certificate is approved.

> If the server requires client authentication, the server performs the steps described in Client Authentication During SSL Handshake.

### Private CA

**CA are usually public and trusted by browser (Comdo, Verisign).
But some oganisations creates private CA, in that case we need to add to the trust the private CA (or intermediate <> subordinate CA), or actually any certificate in the chain).** To not confuse with server exception.

### Client Authentication During SSL Handshake

From:https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19424-01/820-4811/6ng8i26ba/index.html (Client Authentication During SSL Handshake)

> SSL-enabled servers can be configured to require client authentication, or cryptographic validation by the server of the client’s identity.

Certificate validation process is similar to server authentification.
But we can add 2 steps (not part of SSL protocol) for that cases between step 4 and 5.

> 5'. Is the user’s certificate listed in the LDAP entry for the user?

> This optional step provides one way for a system administrator to revoke a user’s certificate even if it passes the tests in all the other steps. The Certificate Management System can automatically remove a revoked certificate from the user’s entry in the LDAP directory. All servers that are set up to perform this step then refuses to authenticate that certificate or establish a connection. If the user’s certificate in the directory is identical to the user’s certificate presented in the SSL handshake, the server goes on to the next step.

> 5''. Is the authenticated client authorized to access the requested resources?

> The server checks what resources the client is permitted to access according to the server’s access control lists (ACLs) and establishes a connection with appropriate access. If the server doesn’t get to step 6 for any reason, the user identified by the certificate cannot be authenticated, and the user is not allowed to access any server resources that require authentication.

Note that (I assume it is after cert validation)

> - When a server configured this way requests client authentication separate piece of digitally signed data to authenticate itself. The server uses the digitally signed data to validate the public key (refer to **note**) in the certificate and to authenticate the identity the certificate claims to represent.
> - The SSL protocol requires the client to create a digital signature by creating a one-way hash from data generated randomly during the handshake and known only to the client and server. The hash of the data is then encrypted with the private key that corresponds to the public key in the certificate being presented to the server.

(**note**): validate client has the private key matching public key

## Application to TLS

Alice (client) -> Bob (server)

### Symetic and asymetric

#### Symetric cryptography is not sufficient because an attacker could steal chiffer key. This key is exchanged between Alice and Bob.

````
@startuml
title Symetric cryptography

Alice->Bob: exchange key in clear
Alice -> Robber: steal the key
Alice -> Alice : encode message with the key
Alice -> Bob : send message to  bob
Alice -> Robber : steal message 
Robber -> Robber : decode the message
Bob -> Bob : decode message with key
@enduml
````


#### This why asymetric is used.

- Bob sends public key to Alice,
- Alice encrypts message with Bob's public key,
- Bob decrypts message with its private key.

````
@startuml
title ASymetric cryptography

Alice -> Bob : initiate authent
Bob -> Alice : send BOB public key
Alice -> Alice : encode message with BOB public key
Alice -> Bob : send message to  bob
Bob -> Bob : decode message with BOB private key
@enduml
````

Using asymmetric cryptography (public key crypto) has an higher cost than symmetric.
This is the reason why, they use a session key, Alice and Bob exchange this session key in asymmetric way,
and then continue to exchange and continue using this session key with symmetric cryptography.

### Man in the middle attach and need of a CA

**Problem**: The public key can be intercepted and substituted (man in the middle attach)
- Robber intercepts Bob's  public key and replace by Robber key.
- Alice encrypts the message using robber key (believing it is the one of Bob).
- She sends it back to robber (thinking it is bob). 
- Robber decodes Alice message. 
- He reencodes it using Bob's public key (to not arouse suspicions) 
- and send it to bob.

**Solution**: Certificate Authority (CA)

This matches that documentation (and many others): https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19424-01/820-4811/6ng8i26ba/index.html (Messages Exchanged During SSL Handshake) and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W7WPMX7arI.

<!--Tanenbaum p913, figure is similar clear stop, note server can send a chain of certificate when not known, it is RSA as in this diagram -->

See actual application here: https://github.com/scoulomb/myDNS/blob/master/2-advanced-bind/5-real-own-dns-application/6-use-linux-nameserver-part-h.md


This is known as RSA handshake diagram is aligned with explanation given here:
https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake. (I mirrored the page [cloudfare-doc.md](cloudfare-doc.md)).

### Diffie-Hellman handshake and RSA handshake

#### Difference

An alternative is Diffie-Hellman (DH) handshake. In RSA handshale step (4) in previous section, client send pre-master secret to server using server certificate public key to encrypt it.

In DH handshake, they exchange a DH parameter (client pub/priv and server pub/priv key generated during negotiation and specific for that exchange) to compute separately a matching pre-master. 
<!-- same principle as master key computation -->
See here the concept: https://www.encryptionconsulting.com/diffie-hellman-key-exchange-vs-rsa/, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange

![public key shared secret](./media/Public_key_shared_secret.svg.png)

In that case client will use server certificate public key to verify a signature provided by server (as for client certificate in RSA handhake) and will not send to server a pre-master key . 

This what is shown here: https://tls.ulfheim.net/ and https://github.com/scoulomb/illustrated-tls.

#### Pre-Master secret and master secret is computed in step "Client/Server encryption keys calculation"


**Client encryption key** is computed via
- server random (from Server Hello)
- client random (from Client Hello)
- server public key (from Server Key Exchange)
- client private key (from Client Key Generation) 

The client multiplies the server's public key by the client's private key using the curve25519() algorithm. The 32-byte result is called the PreMasterSecret/


The client then calculates 48 bytes of the MasterSecret from the PreMasterSecret using the following method:

````
seed = "master secret (here a string)" + client_random + server_random
a0 = seed
a1 = HMAC-SHA256(key=PreMasterSecret, data=a0)
a2 = HMAC-SHA256(key=PreMasterSecret, data=a1)
p1 = HMAC-SHA256(key=PreMasterSecret, data=a1 + seed)
p2 = HMAC-SHA256(key=PreMasterSecret, data=a2 + seed)
MasterSecret = p1[all 32 bytes] + p2[first 16 bytes]
````
<!-- consistent with 
master_secret = PRF(pre_master_secret,
            "master secret",
             ClientHello.random +
             ServerHello.random) [0..47];
where seed => PRF
-->

Once we have master secret (**same in RSA method**), we compute encrpytion key

````
seed = "key expansion" + server_random + client_random
a0 = seed
a1 = HMAC-SHA256(key=MasterSecret, data=a0)
a2 = HMAC-SHA256(key=MasterSecret, data=a1)
a3 = HMAC-SHA256(key=MasterSecret, data=a2)
a4 = ...
p1 = HMAC-SHA256(key=MasterSecret, data=a1 + seed)
p2 = HMAC-SHA256(key=MasterSecret, data=a2 + seed)
p3 = HMAC-SHA256(key=MasterSecret, data=a3 + seed)
p4 = ...
p = p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 ...
client write mac key = [first 20 bytes of p]
server write mac key = [next 20 bytes of p]
client write key = [next 16 bytes of p]
server write key = [next 16 bytes of p]
client write IV = [next 16 bytes of p]
server write IV = [next 16 bytes of p]
````


**Server encryption key** is computed via
- server random (from Server Hello)
- client random (from Client Hello)
- client public key (from Client Key Exchange)
- server private key (from Server Key Generation) 

The server multiplies the client's public key by the server's private key using the curve25519() algorithm. The 32-byte result is called the PreMasterSecret.

This is identical to the PreMasterSecret found by the client, therefore the following calculations are indentical. 

<!--pirvate keys are secret colors -->

We use: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman to reach same secret (Client MasterSecret == Server MasterSecret)

### Exchange key and their usage 

We saw following key were used for symetric encrpyption (derivated from Master secret)

- client write mac key 
- server write mac key 
- client write key 
- server write key
- client write IV
- server write IV

Why several keys?

From https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/1139/what-is-the-purpose-of-four-different-secrets-shared-by-client-and-server-in-ssl

> The encryption part requires a key (and an IV for symmetric encryption algorithms which use CBC mode, and this is subject to a few subtleties which depend on the SSL protocol version, so I will not detail these here). The MAC also needs a key. Using the same key for two distinct algorithms is, as a general rule, not recommended at all: there may be unwanted interactions between the two algorithms, an improbable but not impossible event which has not been thoroughly studied. So, to be on the safe side, we generated two keys, one for encryption and one for the MAC. The two keys come from the master secret, but the derivation mechanism is like a hash function, so it supposedly makes it impossible to guess the MAC key even if you know the encryption key, and vice versa. Since TLS has a key derivation function (the "PRF") which can produce outputs of arbitrary length...

See Tanenbaum p915 (figure 8.51), for the MAC usage when transmitting data with SSL. We can see message is fragmented into blocks, block is compressed, MAC is added and then block is chiffred, and a header is added. MAC guarantees data integrity.

<!-- see also: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31009358/tls-mac-message-verification -->

### SSL in short 

SSL/TLS establishes a secured connexion between 2 sockets ensuring
- Parameter negotiation between client and server
- Authentification of server by client (and vice versa in mTLS) (certificate, [signature](./in-learning-complement/learning-ssl-tld.md#digital-signature)) 
- Secret of communication (encrpyption key)
- protection of data integrity (MAC). See [MD5 and MAC key](./bitcoin-appendix.md#note)

<!-- https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-mq/7.5?topic=ssl-how-tls-provide-authentication-confidentiality-integrity -->

SSL has two sub-protocol to
- Establih a secure connexion
- Use secure  connection

SSL is over TCP.

Ref. Tanenbaum p915

## Link with http over socket

When we implemented our own http client here: https://github.com/scoulomb/http-over-socket/blob/main/main.py
This part (tls handshake):

````python
https_context.wrap_socket(raw_socket, server_hostname=connection.hostname)
````

matches this part of the flow explained here!


## Mutual auth (mTLS)

When not done Alice has the guarantee she talks to Bob, but not vice-versa/
Bob does not have the gurantee he is talking to Alice.

## self-signed certificate 

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-signed_certificate): In cryptography and computer security, a self-signed certificate is a certificate that is not signed by a certificate authority (CA).

Also quoting: https://www.keyfactor.com/blog/self-signed-certificate-risks/
> Another strategy is to issue self-signed SSL certificates. A self-signed certificate is one that is not signed by a CA at all – neither private nor public. In this case, the certificate is signed with its own private key, instead of requesting it from a public or a private CA.

Some CA like let's encrypt are free.
