<p>BIG-IP&nbsp;is built to handle SSL traffic in load balancing scenario
 and meet most of the security requirements effectively. The 3 common 
SSL configurations that can be set up on LTM device are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>SSL Offloading</li>
	<li>SSL Passthrough</li>
	<li>Full SSL Proxy / SSL Re-Encryption / SSL Bridging / SSL Terminations</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="sectiontitle">Environment</span></p>

<ul>
	<li>Configuration objects and settings: Virtual Server, Client SSL and Server SSL profiles</li>
	<li>BIG-IP, LTM</li>
</ul>

<p>Typical load balancing infrastructure setup would be 
Client---&gt;BIG-IP VIP ----&gt;Servers hosting applications i.e. client
 traffic will be directed to a load balancer like BIG-IP&nbsp;which in 
return (using complex algorithm) send the traffic to an appropriate 
server.<br>
<br>
<strong>SSL Offloading</strong> - In this method the client traffic to 
BIG-IP is sent as encrypted. Instead of the server decrypting and 
re-encrypting the traffic BIG-IP would handle that part. So the client 
traffic is decrypted by the BIG-IP and the decrypted traffic is sent to 
the server. The return communication from the server to client is 
encrypted by the BIG-IP and sent back to the client. Thus sparing the 
server additional load of encryption and decryption. All the server 
resources can now be fully utilized to serve the application content or 
any other purpose they are built to do.<br>

Note:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The communication between the server BIG-IP and server is in clear txt.</li>
	<li>Servers are setup to listen on unsecure ports ex Port 80.</li>
	<li>Since the BIG-IP decrypts the HTTP traffic it has now the ability 
to read the content (header, txt, cookies etc.) and all the persistence 
options can be applied. (Source address, Destination address, Cookies, 
SSL, SIP, Universal, MSRDP)</li>
</ol>
<strong>SSL Pass through</strong> - As the name suggests the BIG-IP will
 just pass the traffic from client to servers absolving itself from any 
SSL related workload. Instead of forwarding SSL handshakes and 
connections to the servers directly it will just pass the client traffic
 to the servers. Usually this setup is used if the applications being 
served are anti SSL proxy or cannot consume decrypted traffic.<br>

Note -&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>Since it’s just pass through LTM cannot read the headers which 
introduces limitations on persistence. Only non SSL information in the 
packet can be used to maintain persistence like source ip address, 
destination ip address.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<strong>SSL Full Proxy</strong> - This method goes by a few names such 
as SSL Re-Encryption, SSL Bridging and SSL Terminations. In this method 
the BIG-IP will re-encrypt the traffic before sending it to the servers.
 Client sends encrypted traffic to BIG-IP , BIG-IP then decrypts it and 
before send it to the servers or pool members re-encrypts it again. This
 method is generally used to satisfy the requirement of traffic to be 
encrypted between the LTM and Servers as well. This requirement might be
 put in place for additional security or prevent intrusion from within 
the network. When this method is used the servers will also have to 
decrypt and encrypt the traffic.<br>

Note –
<ol>
	<li>The communication between the server LTM and server is secure.</li>
	<li>Servers are setup to listen on secure ports ex Port 443.</li>
	<li>Since the LTM initially decrypts the HTTP traffic it still has the 
ability to read the content (header, txt, cookies etc.) and all the 
persistence options can be applied same as SSL Offloading. (Source 
address, Destination address, Cookies, SSL, SIP, Universal, MSRDP)</li>
</ol>
