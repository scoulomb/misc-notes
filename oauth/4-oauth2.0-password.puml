' The Password grant requires that the application collect the userâ€™s password. This is of course the exact problem that OAuth was created to avoid in the first place. So why is the Password grant included as part of OAuth?
' The original reason the Password grant was added to OAuth was to allow pre-OAuth applications to upgrade to OAuth without any user interaction.
