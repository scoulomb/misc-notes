## WOL


https://github.com/scoulomb/misc-notes/blob/8a067074b1e0b6ceb57b3fce8c6885bf4dc8175e/NAS-setup/README.md

### Get MAC @dresss of NAS

Need to find MAC when NAS is turned on ! 

````
scoulomb@scoulomb-HP-Pavilion-TS-Sleekbook-14:~$ arp -a local.nas.coulombel.net
nas (192.168.1.88) at 24:5e:be:3f:2b:f7 [ether] on wlo1
````

or via router web UI (`192.168.1.1`).


### Shut down the NAS

Then shut down via
- NAS UI (or scheduled power off) 
- QNAP manager Android app 
- button

or ssh (seems does not disable WOL) 

````
scoulomb@scoulomb-HP-Pavilion-TS-Sleekbook-14:~$ ssh admin@192.168.1.88 /sbin/poweroff #(-f) most of tests done with -f but avoid
admin@192.168.1.88's password: # could use ssh key here
````
If we open UI before SSH will see service shut down progress

Power cut could cause issue, https://community.synology.com/enu/forum/17/post/21402


### etherwake

https://www.mkssoftware.com/docs/man1/etherwake.1.asp

Then `sudo apt install etherwake`

````
scoulomb@scoulomb-HP-Pavilion-TS-Sleekbook-14:~$ sudo etherwake 24:5e:be:3f:2b:f7 
SIOCGIFHWADDR on eth0 failed: No such device
````

We have to specify the interface!

````
oulomb@scoulomb-HP-Pavilion-TS-Sleekbook-14:~$ etherwake -h -u
etherwake: invalid option -- 'h'
usage: etherwake [-i <ifname>] [-p aa:bb:cc:dd[:ee:ff]] 00:11:22:33:44:55

        This program generates and transmits a Wake-On-LAN (WOL)
        "Magic Packet", used for restarting machines that have been
        soft-powered-down (ACPI D3-warm state).
        It currently generates the standard AMD Magic Packet format, with
        an optional password appended.

        The single required parameter is the Ethernet MAC (station) address
        of the machine to wake or a host ID with known NSS 'ethers' entry.
        The MAC address may be found with the 'arp' program while the target
        machine is awake.

        Options:
                -b      Send wake-up packet to the broadcast address.
                -D      Increase the debug level.
                -i ifname       Use interface IFNAME instead of the default 'eth0'.
                -p <pw>         Append the four or six byte password PW to the packet.
                                        A password is only required for a few adapter types.
                                        The password may be specified in ethernet hex format
                                        or dotted decimal (Internet address)
                -p 00:22:44:66:88:aa
                -p 192.168.1.1
scoulomb@scoulomb-HP-Pavilion-TS-Sleekbook-14:~$
````

So 

````
scoulomb@scoulomb-HP-Pavilion-TS-Sleekbook-14:~$ sudo etherwake -i wlo1  24:5e:be:3f:2b:f7 
````

**Warning**: `-p` is for the password and not for the port.

### pywakeonlan

or use Python equivalent https://github.com/remcohaszing/pywakeonlan 

````
pip install wakeonlan
scoulomb@scoulomb-HP-Pavilion-TS-Sleekbook-14:~$ sudo wakeonlan 24:5e:be:3f:2b:f7
[sudo] password for scoulomb: 
[Tested OK after ssh shutdown]
````
or via python console 
<!-- tested OK - 2 beeps + UI-->

````
scoulomb@scoulomb-HP-Pavilion-TS-Sleekbook-14:~$ sudo pip install wakeonlan # install as sudo

>>> from wakeonlan import send_magic_packet

````
With python I had to send several time command (or was not patient)

More raw solution (not tested):https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31588035/bash-one-line-command-to-send-wake-on-lan-magic-packet-without-specific-tool

### Socket and Python 

Similar to https://github.com/scoulomb/http-over-socket/blob/main/1-client/cli.py

Code from wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN

````
scoulomb@scoulomb-HP-Pavilion-TS-Sleekbook-14:~$ cat mywol.py
import socket

def wol(lunaMacAddress: bytes):
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
    s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_BROADCAST, 1)

    magic = b'\xff' * 6 + lunaMacAddress * 16
    s.sendto(magic, ('<broadcast>', 7))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # pass to wol the mac address of the ethernet port of the appliance to wakeup
    wol(b'\x24\x5e\xbe\x3f\x2b\xf7')
scoulomb@scoulomb-HP-Pavilion-TS-Sleekbook-14:~$ python3 mywol.py
````

It works with both port 7 and port 9.

`'<broadcast>'` matches IP `255.255.255.255`.
This can be verified by doing 

````
scoulomb@scoulomb-HP-Pavilion-TS-Sleekbook-14:~$ sudo tcpdump -i wlo1 port 7
[sudo] password for scoulomb:
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v[v]... for full protocol decode
listening on wlo1, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), snapshot length 262144 bytes
16:55:18.726292 IP scoulomb-HP-Pavilion-TS-Sleekbook-14.54274 > 255.255.255.255.echo: UDP, length 102
````

We can replace in our SFR lan by `192.168.1.255`.

**Notes**:
Note that it matches default value of pywakeonlan: https://github.com/remcohaszing/pywakeonlan#as-a-standalone-script

### Etherwake does not use UDP

Our etherwake version does not allow to go through UDP (no IP and Port): Cf `-b` field does not allow to set an IP and port not pressent as option.

I suspect Etherwake use ARP directly. This also explains why: https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/wakeonlan
> Contrairement à wakeonlan, le paquet etherwake ne permet pas de démarrer un pc en passant par internet. Nous installerons donc wakeonlan disponible dans le dépôt universe. 

Assumption is confirmed in the code https://coral.googlesource.com/busybox/+/refs/heads/release-chef/networking/ether-wake.c#101.
It uses `SOCK_PACKET` or `SOCK_RAW`, see here:https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socket.2.html
And not `SOCK_DGRAM` (UDP) or `SOCK_STREAM` (TCP): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5815675/what-is-sock-dgram-and-sock-stream

### How does it work?

#### ARP

From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol

> Two computers in an office (Computer 1 and Computer 2) are connected to each other in a local area network by Ethernet cables and network switches, with no intervening gateways or routers. Computer 1 has a packet to send to Computer 2. Through DNS, it determines that Computer 2 has the IP address 192.168.0.55.

> To send the message, it also requires Computer 2's MAC address. First, Computer 1 uses a cached ARP table to look up 192.168.0.55 for any existing records of Computer 2's MAC address (00:EB:24:B2:05:AC). If the MAC address is found, it sends an Ethernet frame containing the IP packet onto the link with the destination address 00:EB:24:B2:05:AC. If the cache did not produce a result for 192.168.0.55, Computer 1 has to send a broadcast ARP request message (destination FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF MAC address), which is accepted by all computers on the local network, requesting an answer for 192.168.0.55.

> Computer 2 responds with an ARP response message containing its MAC and IP addresses. As part of fielding the request, Computer 2 may insert an entry for Computer 1 into its ARP table for future use.

> Computer 1 receives and caches the response information in its ARP table and can now send the packet.[7]
ARP probe

Then when message exchanged can use TCP/UDP layer  encapsulation over ethernet.
See OSI layer and encapsulation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(networking)

#### WOL

WOL works in a similar fashion:

From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN

> Ethernet connections, including home and work networks, wireless data networks and the Internet itself, are based on frames sent between computers. WoL is implemented using a specially designed frame called a magic packet, which is sent to all computers in a network, among them the computer to be awakened. The magic packet contains the MAC address of the destination computer, an identifying number built into each network interface card ("NIC") or other ethernet device in a computer, that enables it to be uniquely recognized and addressed on a network. Powered-down or turned off computers capable of Wake-on-LAN will contain network devices able to "listen" to incoming packets in low-power mode while the system is powered down. If a magic packet is received that is directed to the device's MAC address, the NIC signals the computer's power supply or motherboard to initiate system wake-up, in the same way that pressing the power button would do.

> **The magic packet is sent on the data link layer (layer 2 in the OSI model) and when sent, is broadcast to all attached devices on a given network, using the network broadcast address; the IP-address (layer 3 in the OSI model) is not used.**

> **Because Wake-on-LAN is built upon broadcast technology, it can generally only be used within the current network subnet. There are some exceptions, though, and Wake-on-LAN can operate across any network in practice, given appropriate configuration and hardware, including remote wake-up across the Internet.**

> In order for Wake-on-LAN to work, parts of the network interface need to stay on. This consumes a small amount of standby power, much less than normal operating power. The link speed is usually reduced to the lowest possible speed to not waste power (e.g. a Gigabit Ethernet NIC maintains only a 10 Mbit/s link). Disabling wake-on-LAN when not needed can very slightly reduce power consumption on computers that are switched off but still plugged into a power socket.[5] The power drain becomes a consideration on battery powered devices such as laptops as this can deplete the battery even when the device is completely shut down.

See also section: "Creating and sending the magic packet"

This why we have to know ethernet address in advance.

Nothe the broadcast made here
- at level 2 (mac): `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF` where payload contain mac@ of device to wake-up
- at level 3 (ip): `192.168.1.255`/`255.255.255.255` (not used in etherwake)

Cf. https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_(informatique)

See here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing

It confirms we can apply unicast, multicast, broadcast at L2 or L3. See https://reussirsonccna.fr/unicast-multicast-broadcast-oui-mais-quelle-couche/ (anycast not sure at L2).

### How to not specify mac address with etherwake (not tried)

See https://linux.die.net/man/8/ether-wake

> The single required parameter is a station (MAC) address or a **host ID that can be translated to a MAC address by an ethers(5) database specified in nsswitch.conf(5)**

### Remote WOL (WOW - Wake On Wan)

See wiki"  "wake on internet"
 
Can use to test: https://www.depicus.com/wake-on-lan/woli

What I did is
- Set static IP@ adress for NAS in LAN: http://192.168.1.1/network/dhcp
- Activated proxy wake on LAN: http://192.168.1.1/network/nat (DNAT)

From https://la-communaute.sfr.fr/t5/installation-et-param%C3%A9trage/wake-on-lan-sur-nb6/td-p/1868922/page/2, we need

 - L'adresse MAC de votre équipement (pour qu'en recevant le magic packet, il sache que c'est lui qui doit se réveiller. Oui en broadcast, tous les équipements de votre LAN receront ce paquet !)
- L'ip publique de votre box
- Masque : 255.255.255.255
- Port : 9

So I tried by changing Python code to `s.sendto(magic, ('109.29.148.109', 9))`
 
 It did not work...
 
 etherwake will not work here as explained above.

I will not explore further...seems a box issue

<!-- worked via web ui, did not manage to reproduce -->

<!-- WOL/WOW concluded OK STOP HERE -->
<!-- disclosed mac@ OK:https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/67893/is-it-dangerous-to-post-my-mac-address-publicly#:~:text=Disclosing%20the%20MAC%20address%20in,you%20and%20your%20immediate%20gateway). -->
